Below is a clean, professional **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for the stock-rating aggregation and search app you described. It focuses on product behavior and features and avoids giving any investment advice.
(Everything is safe for teens—no instructions for trading, just product design.)

# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Product Name:** StockLens

## **Version:** 1.0

## **Owner:** Product Team

## **Last Updated:** 02 Dec 2025

# **1. Overview**

**StockLens** is a cross-platform stock information app that aggregates analyst ratings from hundreds of brokerage firms and presents them in a simple, searchable interface. Users can look up any supported stock by ticker, view key metrics (latest price, P/E ratio, recent price history, MACD), and save stocks to their personal watchlist.

The app does **not** require login; users are identified using a **unique user ID token** (auto-generated on first app open), allowing lightweight storage of favorites in the database.

  * MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator data
* Help users track stocks through a **watchlist**—without requiring login.

### **Non-Goals**

## **4.4 Watchlist (User Data Storage Without Login)**

  * Stored locally in device storage.
* This ID is used for storing user preferences in backend DB.

### **Capabilities**

* Save any stock to watchlist
* Remove stocks anytime
* Database rows linked to userID
* No personal information stored
* No authentication required

### **Technical Requirements**

* CRUD endpoints:

  * `POST /watchlist/{userID}`
  * `GET /watchlist/{userID}`
  * `DELETE /watchlist/{userID}/{ticker}`

---

# **5. Functional Requirements**

## **5.1 Search**

* **FR1:** System must return stock details within < 1 second (for cached data).
* **FR2:** Search must support partial ticker matching.
* **FR3:** If data cannot load, display fallback messaging.

## **5.2 Stock Data Fetch**

* **FR4:** Backend fetches latest stock price at least every X minutes (configurable).
* **FR5:** Backend stores 30/90/180-day historical series.
* **FR6:** MACD is computed from historical price data at backend.

## **5.3 Watchlist**

* **FR7:** Users must be able to add a stock to watchlist with one tap.
* **FR8:** Users must be able to remove a stock with one tap.
* **FR9:** Watchlist persists across sessions via userID.

---

# **6. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Performance**

* API response time < 800ms for cached endpoints.
* App search box must not block UI thread.

### **Scalability**

* Infrastructure must support growth to millions of anonymous user IDs.

### **Security**

* No personal info is stored.
* UserIDs must be non-guessable.
* All API traffic encrypted via HTTPS.

### **Compliance**

* App does **not** conduct financial advising or trading.
* Content is strictly informational.

---

# **7. Data Sources & Architecture (High-Level)**

### **Backend Data Flow**

1. Aggregation engine ingests brokerage ratings via licensed sources.
2. Market data provider supplies raw price, P/E, and historical data.
3. MACD computation handled via backend analytics module.
4. REST API provides structured responses to mobile/web clients.

### **Client-Side**

* React / Swift / Kotlin (platform dependent).
* Local storage for userID.
* Chart rendering using a lightweight library.

---

# **8. User Flows**

## **Flow: First-Time User**

1. Install → Open app
2. App generates `userID`
3. User searches a ticker
4. User taps “☆ Save to Watchlist”
5. System stores record under userID in backend DB
6. User returns and sees stored watchlist

---

# **9. Success Metrics**

* **Search Response Time** < 1s
* **Watchlist Save Success Rate** > 99%
* **API Uptime** 99.9%
* **User Returning Rate (7-day)** increases >= 20% after watchlist launch

---

# **10. Future Enhancements (Not in Scope for v1)**

* Push notifications for price movements
* Social sentiment data
* Multi-device sync
* Full authentication system
* Portfolio tracking
